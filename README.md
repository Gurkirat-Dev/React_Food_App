# 🍽️ React NamasteDev – Food Ordering Website

This is a Swiggy-inspired food ordering web application built using **React**. It was created as a project from the **Namaste React** series. The app allows users to explore restaurants, search and filter them, and view detailed menus — all dynamically fetched from a live API.
